## Tools Used:
Vivado – For design synthesis and implementation.

Questa – For simulation and functional verification.


## Key Achievements:
1.Structured the design using two sub-modules to improve modularity and organization: MUX_reg – Responsible for registered multiplexing to ensure data synchronization and stability.
MUX4x1 – A 4-to-1 multiplexer that facilitates flexible data path selection.

2.Implemented arithmetic operations such as multiplication, addition/subtraction, and cascaded processing.

3.Optimized data flow and synchronization to enhance overall computational efficiency.
